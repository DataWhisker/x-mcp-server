## Claude Desktop Configuration

To connect the X MCP server with Claude desktop, you need to configure it in the Claude settings. Follow these steps:

1. Open File Explorer
2. Navigate to the Claude config directory:
   - Press Win + R
   - Type `%APPDATA%/Claude` and press Enter
   - If the Claude folder doesn't exist, create it

3. Create or edit `claude_desktop_config.json`:
   - If the file doesn't exist, create a new file named `claude_desktop_config.json`
   - If it exists, open it in a text editor (like Notepad)

4. Add the following configuration, replacing the placeholder values with your actual API credentials from the previous section:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "x": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["%USERPROFILE%/Projects/MCP Basket/x-server/build/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "TWITTER_API_KEY": "paste-your-api-key-here",
        "TWITTER_API_SECRET": "paste-your-api-key-secret-here",
        "TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN": "paste-your-access-token-here",
        "TWITTER_ACCESS_SECRET": "paste-your-access-token-secret-here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

5. Save the file and restart Claude desktop

Note: Make sure to:
- Replace all four credential values with your actual API keys and tokens
